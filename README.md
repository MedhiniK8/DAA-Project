# DAA-Project
An Optimized Crew Scheduling Algorithm designed to efficiently assign crew to flights.

## Overview -<br>
The **Airline Crew Scheduling System** is an algorithmic optimization tool designed to solve the logistical challenge of allocating flight crews to flight schedules.<br>
## 🚀 Key Features

**Conflict Detection:** Automatically flags overlapping schedules or unavailable crew members.<br>
**Fatigue Management:** Enforces a mandatory **15-minute cool-down period** after every flight to ensure pilot well-being (SDG 3).<br>
**Cost Optimization:** Minimizes "paid idle time" by chaining flights efficiently using Greedy logic.
